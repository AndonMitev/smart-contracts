# (Smart) Fiat Tokens

ERC20 is a suggested specification for Ethereum tokens. Once approved as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), it will become a part of the standards for the Ethereum platform.

Smart contracts adhering to the specification have a common interface to token-related functionality and events.

![Our token system design](docs/token-design.png)
*Contracts are represented by grey boxes and libraries by blue boxes with rounded corners*
</p>

Our tokens are designed as a token system and implemented using Solidity libraries. A token system is a methodology which aims to separate the token into three modules, providing the means for composable and upgradable tokens.

1. *Frontend*

    This contract implements the token standard and provides a permanent Ethereum address for the token system. All method calls on this contract are forwarded to the controller.

2. *Controller*

    The controller is responsible for the business logic, which is implemented as a library. Our controllers are further separated by the functionality they provide into; standard controller, mintable controller and smart controller.

3. *Storage*

    Permanent token storage for controllers. Should the storage layout change in the future a new token storage with the extra data fields referencing the old token storage.


Using this design we're able to upgrade the business logic &dash; to fix bugs or add functionality &dash; while providing a fixed address on the blockchain and permanent access to the token bookkeeping.

## Building

1. Clone the repository
	```sh
	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/monerium/smart-contracts.git
	$ cd smart-contracts
	```

2. Install dependencies

	```sh
	$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
	$ npm install -g truffle
	```

3. Run testrpc

	`$ testrpc`

4. Compile token system

	`$ make compile`

5. Deploy

	`$ make migrate`

6. Run test suite

	`$ make test`


## Implementation

The token system is implemented using Solidity, the most widely used high level language targetting the EVM. We build upon community vetted libraries where possible to minimise the risk of bugs.

Additional functionality has been implemented in `MintableTokenLib.sol` and `SmartTokenLib.sol`. This includes minting and burning tokens and defining validators who determine whether token transactions are valid or not.
